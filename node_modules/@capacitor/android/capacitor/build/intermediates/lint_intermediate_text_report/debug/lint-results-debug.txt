/Users/mcd/kwaliteitscontroleapp/node_modules/@capacitor/android/capacitor/lint-baseline.xml: Information: 4 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true. Unmatched issue types: DefaultLocale, SetJavaScriptEnabled, StaticFieldLeak (2) [LintBaseline]
